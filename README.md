**The first US employment-law MCP server for AI assistants.**

Connect Claude, GPT, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI to 50-state employment compliance data. Minimum wage, overtime, paid leave, pay transparency, discrimination, background checks, non-competes, safety — all queryable in seconds, not hours of DOL site spelunking.

## 30-Second Demo

```
You:  Is this California job posting compliant?
      "Senior Backend Engineer — remote, salary TBD, 200-person company"

HR-Compliance-MCP:  No — 1 violation found.

  California requires a salary range in all public job postings for
  employers with 15+ employees.

  Cal. Lab. Code § 432.3 — penalty $100-$10,000 per violation.
  Effective 2023-01-01. Your employer size (200) is well over the
  15-employee threshold.

  Fix: add a posted salary range before publishing.
```

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv hr-mcp-env

# Windows
hr-mcp-env\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source hr-mcp-env/bin/activate

# Install from GitHub (PyPI release coming soon)
pip install git+https://github.com/Mahender22/hr-compliance-mcp.git

# Windows
set HR_MCP_DEMO=true

hr-compliance-mcp
```

| `get_pay_transparency` | Salary-range posting rules, thresholds, penalty ranges |

### Leave

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `get_sick_leave` | Accrual rate, cap, carryover, eligible employers |
| `get_family_leave` | State FMLA variants, job protection, paid vs unpaid |
| `get_vacation_policy` | Use-it-or-lose-it legality, PTO payout on termination |
| `get_voting_leave` | Paid/unpaid time off to vote |
| `get_bereavement_leave` | Mandatory bereavement rules |

### Compliance

## Coverage

### Live States (8)

California (CA), New York (NY), Colorado (CO), Washington (WA), Massachusetts (MA), Illinois (IL), New Jersey (NJ), Oregon (OR)

These 8 states account for roughly 45% of US employment-law query volume and hold the densest pay-transparency, sick-leave, and non-compete requirements.

### Pipeline

The remaining 42 states + DC are on the roadmap, with wage/hour data scheduled first (highest query volume), then leave, then full compliance coverage. Data is scraped from state DOL sites, parsed locally, and reviewed before publishing — no LLM hallucinations in the shipped data.

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐     MCP      ┌──────────────────┐     local     ┌──────────────┐

└──────────────┘               └──────────────────┘               └──────────────┘
```

Runs entirely on your machine. No API keys, no telemetry, no data leaves your box.

## Pricing

**The MCP server is free and open source.** MIT licensed, all 19 tools.

A paid REST API with the same data is planned — HTTP/JSON surface, usage-based billing, webhook alerts when state laws change. [Join the waitlist](https://github.com/Mahender22/hr-compliance-mcp/issues) or watch this repo.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahender22/hr-compliance-mcp.git
